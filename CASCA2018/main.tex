    \begin{itemize}
      \item established in 1985, first members Dick Henrickson+Peter Martin
      \item fills several niches
      \item world leading theoretical astrophysics institute
      \item supports Canadian theory: attract+retain HQP, over 20
        CITAzens in faculty positions in Canada, +NF,GS
      \item leadership in Canadian HPC: from SUN, SGI to McKenzie
        (top500 record in Canada), Niagara
      \item draw new funding into astrophysics: SOSCIP, CERC, ORF-RE, OCE, RPP
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item granted every two years for excellence in research in astrophysical dynamics. 
      \item Jeffrey Bishop was one of CITAâ€™s first postdoctoral
        fellows. He was killed in an automobile accident shortly after
        leaving the Institute and this award was one of several
        created by his mother, Mrs. Muriel Simmons, to remember his
        life and work. Her donation is matched by CITA.
