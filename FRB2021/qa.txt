Ue-Li -- Is there any smoking-gun evidence of plasma lensing in the case of FRBs?

Are FRBs really going to be competitive for cosmological parameters and lensing studies compared to Einstein Telescope/Cosmic Explorer/LISA? Those BH mergers are also coherent, with more information in the waveform.

Great stuff Ue-Li but we still need to discuss the degree to which scattering will destroy some (but not all) of the coherence effects.

There has been talk previously about how differential scattering along different sight lines for gravitationally lensed FRBs. Can you comment on whether you think that will destroy the coherence?
